This work has been possible due to the invaluable support of my Daily supervisors Dr. Fran√ßois Signol and Laura Arnal whose guidance and patience highly motivated me to go further, and also Dr. Sanne Abeln, for her advise and supervision. They all provided me the necessary directions to develop and conclude this work at best effort.

Also, thanks to the ITI team which provided me with the necessary documentation, tools and data, all used in this project.
