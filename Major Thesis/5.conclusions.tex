Redundant variables reduce the predictive power of actual informative features. Besides, their presence increase time complexity both at \emph{ensemble} level and in our \emph{swapping} workflow.

Data type heavily influences in swapper performance in detencting redundancy.

Feature selection on homogeneous categorial data set containing thousands of variables needs careful management of relations and dependencies based on sole values. Semantical information such as items (gene, proteins, etc.) interactions can ease the task.
