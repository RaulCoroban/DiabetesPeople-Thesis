This project aims to study the limits of ensemble feature selection varying the amount of variables, observations, inducers and any other hyper-parameter of the algorithm. Also we will study the behaviour of ensemble feature selection with redundant variables.

Research question(s):
What are the limits of ensemble feature selection in identifying relevant variables?
- Data types. They are sensitive to the swapper and any redundancy method, although it can be tackled if we use MRMR.
What is the influence of redundant variables on feature selection?
- They divide the vote and lower the rank of the real features.
\\

The project will be developed mainly in Python language, using a Machine learning core library based on scikit-learn. Also we dispose of controlled synthetic data and real databases containing type 2 diabetes and breast cancer.
